# MikeyReactPortfolio
This application is a new porfolio designed with react. I constructed a basic skeleton and provided essentail data for a simple portfolio. I added some style with existing open source code online, such as customizable moving graphics and a pdf reader. It seems in the world of react, its important to understand there are many sources of code, and that proficiency comes when a developer can pull from existing resources and mold those resources to fit their needs.
